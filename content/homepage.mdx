## Hello, my name is Brent.

For the past 10+ years, I've been taking bold product ideas from concept to launch—
whether building at scrappy startups or accelerating Fortune 1000s to startup speed. 
Since 2016, 3 of 5 startups I've led product at were acquired. 2 are still operating.

Most recently, I co-founded [SaySo](https://www.justsayso.co), 
a clearance commerce platform for the furniture industry. We incubated at UP.Labs with 
a major furniture retailer, raised $4M, and launched an MVP in 4 months that generated 
$350K+ in gross sales within 18 months. Operations have been transitioned to the 
corporate partner.

Prior to SaySo, I was the Venture Head of Product at [UP.Labs](https://www.uplabs.us)—a 
venture lab building and launching startups with global corporations like Porsche AG, 
Alaska Airlines, JB Hunt, and Wabash. There, I led the definition and development of 
2 MVPs from concept to launch and secured $13M in funding across multiple ventures. 
My team and I developed repeatable frameworks for navigating complex stakeholder 
environments while maintaining startup speed.

At [BCG Digital Ventures](https://www.bcg.com/x/) (the 
venture building arm of Boston Consulting Group now called BCG X), I led multiple initiatives including 
a 9-figure digital transformation for a Fortune 1000 HR tech client that resulted in 
strategic acquisition, and a CEO-driven product vision project with UPS's Global Strategy 
Office. The role involved presenting to C-suite executives and building repeatable 
processes for aligning corporate stakeholders with bold product strategies.

In 2016, I co-founded [Svrf](https://svrf.com)—the 
first search API for 3D face filters—where I led product and engineering. We powered 
280M+ AR experiences for brands like Snapchat, GIPHY, Nicki Minaj, and MTV. 
Svrf [was acquired by Poplar in 2020](https://poplar.studio/blog/ar-creative-platform-poplar-acquires-svrf-inc/).

I've also worked with [Brud](https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/lil-miquela-digital-avatar-instagram-influencer.html), 
creators of virtual influencer Miquela (acquired by Dapper Labs). Earlier in my career, 
I led the product rebuild at [AnyMeeting](https://www.intermedia.com/products/anymeeting-video-conferencing) that became the primary acquisition target when 
Intermedia acquired the company in 2017.

In 2018, I was recognized by [Forbes 30 Under 30](https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2018/media/). 
I'm also a [Techstars NYC](https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/announcing-the-techstars-new-york-city-winter-2017-class) alumnus.
